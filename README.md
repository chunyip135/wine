# wine
Machine learning with Scikit-learn on wine datasets.

Wine datasets can be accessd through :
1. Scikit-learn buit in datasets. ( Used in this script )
2. Datasets at UCI machine learning repository website

Algorithm used :
1. KNN
2. Decision tree
3. Random forest
4. Adaboost
5. Gradient boosting
6. Voting Classifier ( finalized model )
